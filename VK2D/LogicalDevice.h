/// that you always free this last (assuming you're not just letting the renderer take care of all
/// this). It could be seen as spaghetti to have something's pointer all over the place, but since
/// A) the vulkan spec says all things allocated on the device must be freed before the device and
/// B) the VK2DLogicalDevice will likely never change beyond the command pools getting reset, its
/// not at all unreasonable to just store the logical device on anything that needs it constantly.
/// TL;DR, always free VK2DLogicalDevice last (or ignore this if you're using VK2DRenderer).
